## Quiz Questions

*Total Questions: 7*

### Question 1

**Points**: 10 | **Difficulty**: beginner

What is the primary communication middleware used by ROS 2?

**Options**:
1. TCP/IP
2. DDS (Data Distribution Service)
3. HTTP/HTTPS
4. WebSocket

**Correct Answer**: DDS (Data Distribution Service)

**Explanation**: ROS 2 uses DDS as its underlying communication middleware, providing a robust publish-subscribe model for distributed systems.

### Question 2

**Points**: 10 | **Difficulty**: beginner

Which command is used to create a new ROS 2 workspace?

**Options**:
1. ros2 create_workspace
2. mkdir -p workspace/src
3. colcon build
4. ros2 init

**Correct Answer**: mkdir -p workspace/src

**Explanation**: A ROS 2 workspace is created by making a directory structure with a src subdirectory where packages are placed.

### Question 3

**Points**: 15 | **Difficulty**: intermediate

ROS 2 nodes can communicate directly with each other without using topics.

**Answer**: False

**Explanation**: ROS 2 nodes primarily communicate through topics using the publish-subscribe pattern, though services and actions provide direct communication for specific use cases.

### Question 4

**Points**: 15 | **Difficulty**: intermediate

What is the purpose of a URDF file in ROS 2?

**Correct Answer**: To define robot models with physical properties, visual representations, and joint configurations

**Explanation**: URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) files define the physical structure of robots including links, joints, sensors, and visual/collision geometries.

### Question 5

**Points**: 20 | **Difficulty**: intermediate

Complete the following Python code to create a simple ROS 2 publisher:

**Code Template**:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from std_msgs.msg import String

class SimplePublisher(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('simple_publisher')
        self.publisher_ = self.create_publisher(String, 'topic', 10)
        timer_period = 1.0
        self.timer = self.create_timer(timer_period, self.______)
        self.count = 0
    
    def timer_callback(self):
        msg = String()
        msg.data = f'Hello World: {self.count}'
        self.publisher_.publish(msg)
        self.get_logger().info(f'Publishing: "{msg.data}"')
        self.count += 1

```

**Answer**: `timer_callback`

**Explanation**: The timer_callback method is passed to create_timer() to be called periodically at the specified rate.

### Question 6

**Points**: 10 | **Difficulty**: beginner

Which ROS 2 command lists all available packages?

**Options**:
1. ros2 pkg list
2. ros2 packages
3. ros2 show packages
4. ros2 list packages

**Correct Answer**: ros2 pkg list

**Explanation**: The 'ros2 pkg list' command displays all packages available in the current ROS 2 environment.

### Question 7

**Points**: 20 | **Difficulty**: intermediate

Match the ROS 2 concept with its description:

**Match the following**:
- Node: Computational unit that performs processing
- Topic: Named channel for message exchange
- Service: Request-response communication pattern
- Action: Long-running goal-oriented task
